//TODO: Use NSLocalizedString for Text: Instead of hardcoding text directly into your user interface elements (such as UILabels, UIButtons, etc.), use NSLocalizedString to define localized strings in your code. NSLocalizedString retrieves the appropriate localized string based on the user's language preferences.
//TODO: Create Localized String Files: Create separate .strings files for each language you want to support in your app. Xcode provides a built-in feature for managing localized strings. You can add new languages and translations directly in Xcode's project navigator.
//TODO: Storyboard and XIB Localization: If you're using Storyboards or XIB files for your user interface, you can localize these files by enabling Base Internationalization and adding localized versions of your Storyboard or XIB files. Xcode allows you to manage separate versions of your user interface elements for each supported language.
//TODO: Test with Different Language Settings: Test your app thoroughly with different language settings to ensure that all text and user interface elements are correctly localized and displayed as expected in each language.
//TODO: Update App Store Metadata: Provide localized app metadata, including app name, description, keywords, and screenshots, for each supported language when submitting your app to the App Store.



//Handle RTL Languages: If your app supports languages with right-to-left (RTL) writing systems (such as Arabic or Hebrew), make sure your user interface elements and layout adapt appropriately for RTL languages.

//Consider Localizing Images and Resources: If your app includes images or other resources with text, consider localizing these resources as well to provide a complete localized experience.
